# Introduction

[GOSU](https://www.libgosu.org/) is a 2D game development library for Ruby and C++.


I am going to use it to learn and have fun, I don't think I am going to make any game anytime soon.

However I want to write some algorithms / coding challenges just for fun.

# Installation

I am going to use the Ruby version of GOSU, so I need to install the gem.

```bash
make install
```

# Usage

Just write `make` and read the documentation there :-)
